# HTML-Project
HTML Project for the Full-Stack Web Technologies postgraduate course. Based on 9gag website (https://9gag.com/)

Hello Pau, I did not have enough time to style everything before the deadline :( but I think the result is pretty good already. There are some things I wanted to improve like making the left column fixed like in the original webpage (like I did in the header). And I could not make the header in flexbox maintain the same width as the main when changing the browser size. Also add style to the links and buttons left.
